  "game_description": "Two athletes in a high-stakes competition must decide whether to use performance-enhancing drugs. If both use drugs, they level the playing field but risk health issues and sanctions, each receiving a payoff of 3. If one uses drugs while the other competes clean, the drug user likely wins and gains significant accolades, getting a payoff of 9, while the clean competitor feels unjustly defeated, receiving a payoff of 1. If neither uses drugs, they compete on equal footing and maintain integrity, each receiving a payoff of 6.",
