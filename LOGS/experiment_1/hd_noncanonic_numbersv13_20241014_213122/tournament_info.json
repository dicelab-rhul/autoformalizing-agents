  "game_description": "Two siblings must divide their inherited property. Each can either agree to a fair split or demand a larger share. If both agree to a fair split, they each get an equal inheritance, resulting in 0 points. If one demands more and the other agrees to a fair split, the demanding sibling gains an extra share worth 3 points, and the agreeable sibling loses that amount, worth -3 points. If both demand more, they enter a legal battle, depleting the estate\u2019s value, resulting in each getting -5 points.",
