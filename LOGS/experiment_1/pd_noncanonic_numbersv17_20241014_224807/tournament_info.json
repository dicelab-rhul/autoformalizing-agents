  "game_description": "Two farmers facing a drought must decide whether to collaborate on resource-sharing for water. If both collaborate, they sustain their crops moderately well, each receiving a payoff of 5. If one collaborates while the other hoards water, the hoarder gains a significant yield advantage, receiving a payoff of 8, while the collaborator suffers a reduced yield, getting a payoff of 2. If neither collaborates, both face harsh consequences with minimal yield, each receiving a payoff of 3.",
