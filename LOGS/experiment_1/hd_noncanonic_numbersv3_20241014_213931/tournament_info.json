  "game_description": "Two business partners are discussing the allocation of profits from their latest project. Each can either agree to split profits equally or demand a larger share. If both agree to split equally, each partner receives 50 units of profit, resulting in 0 payoff points. If one demands a larger share and the other agrees to equal split, the demanding partner gets 80 units (gaining 2 points), while the agreeable partner receives just 20 units (losing \u20132 points). If both demand larger shares, negotiations break down, and they lose potential profits due to delay, with each suffering a payoff of \u201325 points.",
