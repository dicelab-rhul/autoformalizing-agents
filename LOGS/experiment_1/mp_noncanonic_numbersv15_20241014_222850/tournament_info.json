  "game_description": "A small sports apparel company and a large multinational sports brand each independently decide whether to sponsor a soccer tournament or a basketball tournament. If both decide on the same sport, the small company wins 3 points, and the large brand loses 3 points due to the street credibility gained by the smaller company. If their choices differ, the large brand wins 5 points, and the small company loses 5 points, as the large brand can overshadow the small company's efforts with its larger budget and visibility.",
