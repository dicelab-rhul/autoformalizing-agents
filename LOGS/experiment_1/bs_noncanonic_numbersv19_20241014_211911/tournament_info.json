  "game_description": "Two siblings are deciding on a family vacation location. One prefers Disneyland for its thrill rides, while the other loves Yellowstone for its natural beauty. They both agree that spending time together is more important. If they pick Disneyland, the amusement park fan earns 2 points, and the nature lover gets 1 point. If they choose Yellowstone, the nature enthusiast gets 2 points, and the thrill-seeker gets 1 point. If they go to different places, they don't have a family vacation, both scoring 0 points.\n",
