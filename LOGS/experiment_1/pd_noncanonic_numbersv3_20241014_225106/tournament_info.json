  "game_description": "Two tech companies must decide whether to cut prices on their highly competitive similar products. If both cut prices, they attract more customers but sacrifice a significant portion of their profits, resulting in a payoff of 4 for each. If one company cuts prices while the other doesn't, the price-cutter gains a major market share, achieving a payoff of 9, while the non-cutter loses customers and profits, getting a payoff of 1. If neither cuts prices, they maintain their current profit levels but miss potential market share growth, each receiving a payoff of 6.",
