  "game_description": "Two neighboring countries must decide whether to implement strict pollution controls. If both implement controls, they incur costs but significantly benefit the environment, each receiving a payoff of 7. If one implements controls and the other doesn't, the non-implementer saves costs and attracts businesses, getting a payoff of 10, while the implementer faces higher costs alone, receiving a payoff of 3. If neither implements controls, they save costs but suffer from collective pollution, each receiving a payoff of 5.",
