  "game_description": "Two neighbors consider jointly organizing a community garden. If both contribute equal effort, they create a thriving garden that benefits everyone for a payoff of 6 points each. If one neighbor works hard while the other slacks off, the hardworking neighbor gains nothing (0 points) due to the lack of full support, and the lazy neighbor gets a moderate benefit worth 3 points from the partial effort. If both avoid contributing, the garden never materializes, leaving them with a small sense of loss worth 1 point each.",
