  "game_description": "A niche fashion brand and a global fashion giant each decide whether to debut a new line of sustainable clothing or a new line of tech-infused apparel. If both opt for the same type of clothing line, the niche brand wins 1 point, and the global giant loses 1 point because of the niche brand's more authentic and original appeal. If their choices differ, the global giant wins 2 points, and the niche brand loses 2 points due to the immense marketing and global distribution capabilities of the giant.",
