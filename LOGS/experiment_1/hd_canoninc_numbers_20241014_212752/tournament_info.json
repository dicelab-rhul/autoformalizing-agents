  "game_description": "Two drivers are on a collision course, each deciding whether to swerve (compromise) or keep going straight (hold firm). If both swerve, they avoid the crash and each gets a payoff of 0 units. If one swerves and the other goes straight, the one who swerves is considered a \"chicken\" and gets -1 unit, while the other gets 1 unit for holding firm. If both go straight, they crash, resulting in a large negative payoff of -10 units for each. This situation, known as the Chicken Game, highlights the risks of brinkmanship and the potential for mutual disaster.\n",
