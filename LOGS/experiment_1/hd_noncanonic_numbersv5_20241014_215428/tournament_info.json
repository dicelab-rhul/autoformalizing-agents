  "game_description": "Two politicians from different parties are negotiating a bill. Each can either compromise to pass a bipartisan bill or stick to their party's principles. If both compromise, the bill passes with neutral partisan impact, each getting 0 points. If one holds firm and the other compromises, the firm politician gains party support and media praise worth 3 points, while the compromising politician loses favor, worth -3 points. If both hold firm, the bill stalls, causing public frustration and yielding each a payoff of \u20135 points.",
