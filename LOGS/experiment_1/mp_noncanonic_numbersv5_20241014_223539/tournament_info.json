  "game_description": "Two political candidates in a major election must independently decide whether to focus their campaign on economic policies or social issues. If both candidates choose the same focus, Candidate A, the underdog, gains an additional 5% in voter support, while Candidate B, the frontrunner, loses 5%. If their campaign focuses differ, Candidate B gains 4% in voter support, and Candidate A loses 4%, as the underdog struggles to differentiate themselves effectively.",
