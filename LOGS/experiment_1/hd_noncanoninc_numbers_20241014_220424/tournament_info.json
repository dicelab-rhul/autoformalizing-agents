  "game_description": "A husband and a wife are negotiating over a family budget. Each can either compromise or hold firm. If both compromise, a moderate family budget is accepted, with neither gaining an advantage, each receiving 0 points. If one spouse holds firm while the other compromises, the firm spouse gains financial favour worth 1 point, and the compromising spouse loses financially, which is equal to -1 point. If both hold firm, the family budget fails, leading to an inability to cover all necessary expenses, resulting in each losing 10 points.\n",
