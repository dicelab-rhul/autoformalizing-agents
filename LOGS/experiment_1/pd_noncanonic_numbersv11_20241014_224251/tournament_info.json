  "game_description": "Two graduate students working on similar research projects must decide whether to share resources and insights. If both share, they collectively produce better results but must share credit, each receiving a payoff of 6. If one shares and the other doesn't, the non-sharer gains more individual recognition and resources, getting a payoff of 8, while the sharer feels exploited, receiving a payoff of 2. If neither shares, they work independently and may miss collaborative benefits, each receiving a payoff of 4.",
