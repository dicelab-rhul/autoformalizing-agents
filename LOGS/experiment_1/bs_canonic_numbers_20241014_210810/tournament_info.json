One prefers to go to the opera and the other prefers to go to a football game, but both prefer to be together rather than apart. If they both choose the opera, the opera lover gets a payoff of 2 units of happiness, and the football lover gets 1 unit. If they both choose the football game, the football lover gets 2 units of happiness, and the opera lover gets 1 unit. If they choose different events, they both get 0 units of happiness.
