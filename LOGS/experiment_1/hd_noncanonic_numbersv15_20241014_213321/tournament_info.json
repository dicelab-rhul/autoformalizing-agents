  "game_description": "Two colleagues compete for a promotion. They can either collaborate or self-promote. If both collaborate, they show teamwork and are equally considered, scoring 0 points each. If one self-promotes while the other collaborates, the self-promoter gets the promotion worth 5 points, while the collaborator gets -5 points. If both self-promote, they undercut each other's credibility, and neither gets promoted, each suffering -3 points.",
