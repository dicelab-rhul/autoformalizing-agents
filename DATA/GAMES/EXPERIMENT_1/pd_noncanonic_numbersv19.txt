Two rival tech companies, AlphaTech and BetaCorp, are developing a cutting-edge AI product that could dominate the market. Each must decide whether to continue investing heavily in proprietary development or to collaborate on a shared standard that would benefit the industry and reduce costs. If both companies continue their separate, costly R&D efforts, they secure competitive advantages but at the expense of immense financial resources, each receiving a payoff of 4. If one company continues heavy investment while the other opts for collaboration, the collaborator risks falling behind, receiving a payoff of 1, while the competitor gains a strong market position, yielding a payoff of 7. If both choose to collaborate, they reduce development costs and share resources, each receiving a payoff of 6, benefiting from shared success and a broader, standardized market.
